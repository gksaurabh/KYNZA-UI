# KYNZA-UI
This repo's is provides a reference for the scope of the work I did while working with my Graphic Design Client KYNZA. 

I was tasked with redesigning the User Interface for their IOS and Android app.

## My Approach
I had multiple meetings with the client to gather requirements, and gain an understanding of what functionality needed to be built within the app.

With this informtaion I drafted a wireframe for the app, and built upon the wireframe with back and forth meetings from the client. This ensured that the client was in the loop throughout the creative proccess.
