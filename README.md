# KYNZA-UI
This repo's is provides a reference for the scope of the work I did while working with my Graphic Design Client KYNZA. I used AdobeXd extensively through out the project along with Adobe Illustrator to create custom objects.

I was tasked with redesigning the User Interface for their [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.kynzagroup.www&hl=en_CA&gl=US&pli=1).

[Here is the final UI-Walkthrough:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hc79sDi3f0U "Kynza UI Walkthrough")


## My Approach
I had multiple meetings with the client to gather requirements, and gain an understanding of what functionality needed to be built within the app.

With this informtaion I drafted a wireframe for the app, and built upon the wireframe with back and forth meetings from the client. This ensured that the client was in the loop throughout the creative proccess. 

## What is Kynza?
Kynza brings rotating saving into the digital age by streamlining the entire experience in one consolidated platform. Our mobile application preserves the time-tested peer-to-peer mutual aid model of cooperative savings, while solving for the administrative burden. With all the tools you need at your fingertips, simply invite and save with your own trusted networks, and let Kynza take care of the rest.
